# CloudForms / ManageIQ AutomationBricks

AutomationBricks is a set of integration primitives for CLoudForms / ManageIQ.
They have been designed to be as easily reusable and implementable as possible.
Documentation is under design, but each Brick will have (soon) a dedicated documentation, including a QuickStart guide. (see later)

## Importing AutomationBricks

### Importing the AutomationBricks Domain
Download the AutomationBricks.zip file.
On a CloudForms/ManageIQ appliance portal do as follow :
 * CloudForms 4.2 (cfme 5.7.\*) or previous : Go to Automate->Import/Export. 
 * CloudForms 4.5 (cfme 5.8.\*) or later : Go to Automation->Automate->Import/Export
Once there, any release click Choose file, select the downloaded zip, click upload.
Select all namespaces than import.

Once imported, your AutomationBricks domain could be disabled. Select your AutomationBricks domain, select Configuration->Edit, check th enabled box option, then save.

### Importing the AutomationBricks dialogs
At current release there are no dialogs within automation bricks. When it will be the case, we will update this short notice.

## Bricks documentation
AutomationBricks will contain several features that will be documented.
As a brand new project, documentation is currently under design.
An initial set of docs were created but have been currently removed as several design changes have occured in the past weeks. In case you would have a set of this doc (initially published on this git) do not use it. It is totally inaccurate and sometimes wrong facing the new release.

This notice will be updated as documentation will be available (blog under design).
